This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

End of the Day note:

While I was not able to complete the task at hand, I just wanted to say whoever came up with the scenario made this a fun and interesting challenge. I absolutely loved the Marvel twist and was excited to write in the "What do you wish you could have done" section that I would have implemented Asimov's 3 laws to prevent the entire take over in the first place.

I had marked out mile markers for myself and felt accomplished at least in my progress:
[x] Connect to Marvel API
[x] Create seed data by iterating through Marvel Characters
[x] Create a successful get request with Credly
[ ] Create a successful post request with Credly
[ ] Create spec files that covered each method and that api's recieved proper statuses
[ ] Style the webpage using bootstrap and custom css
[ ] Go back and add images to the Marvel Characters

Take Aways:
- Next time, use character over hero to avoid pluralization issues (Heros vs Heroes) with ruby magic and just as a developer.
- As rusty as I am with APIs, I was happy to see some parts were like riding a bike again. I also learned where I need some more work (post requests, debugging and webhooks)
- I felt good challenging myself with using new libraries, HTTParty, where I felt comfortable, and leaning back into familiar libraries, Faraday, when I wasnt.

I appreciate your time and effort with creating this challenge. Although I did not complete, I do not feel my time was wasted as I have some important take aways for myself. If you have any follow up or suggestions, I would be more than happy to listen or discuss.
